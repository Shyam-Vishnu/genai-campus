GenAI Campus v2.4 (Thumbnail videos + Certificate)
Built: 2025-11-01 16:46:27

This build removes YouTube iframes (which can throw Error 153) and replaces them
with click-to-watch thumbnails that open in a new tab. Certificate generation
still unlocks at 100% and can be downloaded/printed from the modal.
